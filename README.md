# School Exam Management System - HSTS

## Overview
The school management seeks to build a computerized information system to centralize all the activity related to school exams and improve the efficiency and reliability of exam management. The goals of the system are:

1. **Exam Creation at Two Levels**:
   - Managing a pool of questions for various subjects and courses.
   - Creating exams from the question pool.

2. **Exam Execution**: Allowing students to take exams.
   
3. **Exam Grading**: Automating the grading process and recording scores.

4. **Data Processing**: Managing, analyzing, and presenting statistics on exams, scores, and students.

## General System Guidelines
The computerized system handles exams in two stages:
1. **Prepared Exams ("Stored")**: Exams that are created and saved for future use.
2. **Active Exams ("Published")**: Exams that are distributed to students. An exam can be used multiple times.

## Exam Creation
The content of the exams is created at two levels: **Questions** and **Exams**. Each teacher can create questions and exams for the subjects they teach.

### 1. Question Creation
Teachers can build a pool of questions for use in exams. A question consists of the following:
- **Text**: The question and instructions for answering.
- **Four Answers**: One of which is marked as the correct answer.
- Each question is associated with one or more courses within a subject and is uniquely identified by a 5-digit number.
  
### 2. Exam Creation
Teachers create exams using questions from the pool. Each exam is identified by a 6-digit number. Exams include:
- **Time limit** (in minutes).
- **Point allocation** for each question.
- **Instructions** or **general remarks** in two categories:
  - For students (visible during the exam).
  - For teachers (not visible to students).

## Exam Execution
Exams can be conducted in two ways:
1. **Manual Exam**: Students download a Word file, solve the exam, and upload their answers back into the system.
2. **Automated Exam**: Students take the exam directly through the system, submitting their answers online.

For both methods, the system:
- Tracks time.
- Automatically closes the exam when the allocated time expires.
- Records the start and end times, number of students who began and completed the exam, and the number of students who didn't finish.

### Time Extension
During an exam, a teacher can extend the time with the approval of the school principal. This change applies only to the current exam session and is recorded in the system.

## Exam Grading
Automatic grading is only available for computerized exams. The system checks answers based on the predefined data and assigns a grade. Teachers can:
- Approve the automatically assigned grade.
- Manually adjust the grade (requiring an explanation).
- Add comments to student submissions.

After grading, the system computes and stores statistics for each exam (average, median, and score distribution across deciles). These statistics are not available to students.

## Data Processing

### 1. Students
Students can view their exam scores and receive a copy of their graded exams for all computerized exams. Access is restricted to their personal results.

### 2. Teachers
Teachers can access reports and statistical analysis for all the exams they have created, even if conducted by other teachers.

### 3. School Principal
The principal can view:
- All data in the system (questions, exams, results).
- Statistical reports generated by the system, such as average, median, and decile distribution. The principal can also request custom reports based on how scores change:
  - Across exams by the same teacher.
  - Across exams within the same course.
  - Across exams by the same student.

The system should be flexible enough to support minimal development work for generating additional reports in the future.

## User Information
Each system user must authenticate with a username and password. All user-related data, including roles and permissions, is managed in a separate user management system. Multiple users can be connected to the system at the same time, but each user can only be logged in once.

## Additional Requirements
- The system must be efficient and user-friendly.
- It should be designed for easy future updates, such as adding users or features.
- In the first phase, the system will operate only over the local network (no internet access), but it should be developed in a way that allows easy integration with a web interface in the future.

## Project Definition
The system should meet the requirements outlined above and be developed in phases as directed throughout the semester. The system will have a distributed operational nature, allowing multiple users to interact with it simultaneously. It will follow a client-server architecture, using a relational database. Communication between the client and server will be based on IP/TCP protocols.

At this stage, a web interface is not required, but the system should be designed for easy web interface implementation in the future.

## Teamwork
The project tasks must be completed collaboratively, with all group members participating in every part of the project. Each member must be involved in the development of all components.
